# ERPCA: Robust Principal Component Analysis for Exponential Family Distributions

Robust Principal Component Analysis for Exponential Family Distributions (eRPCA) is a method for jointly recovering embedded low-rank structures and corresponding sparse anomalies from data matrices corrupted by non-Gaussian noise from the exponential family distribution This package implements eRPCA in both single group setting and mutil-group setting. The implementation refers [the paper][Lin] and its [R implementation][R Implementation].
